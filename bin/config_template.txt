;To use google vision you'll need your own Cloud Vision API key. (this is so google can see who is using it and charge you money if you
;hammer it too much.  More info here:  https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/before-you-begin
;Also, visit https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/translate.googleapis.com and enable the Translation API.
;You also need to enable the Text To Speech API so it can talk:  https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=texttospeech.googleapis.com
;Note: it will use the WaveNet voices when it can for the highest quality.

;Note:  Don't share your google API key!

;Set the mode to work in. 

;desktop - this allows you to translate from things you are doing on your desktop, it works with anything that
;will render to a window (emulators, webpages, etc).  Won't work with full screen usually, only windowed mode.

;camera - this is my setup for capturing from live HDMI video. Designed so the output will fill a second monitor
;and be mixed with the HDMI signal later down the chain with a live luma-key effect so I can translate while playing
;on real hardware.  This would allow you to translate while playing PS4 games with zero lag for example.  Alternatively, desktop mode could be
;used on top of an elgato capture window or something too. 
;My retro setup uses a Hydra SCART switcher with two outputs, one for the CRT and one for the OSSC to get HDMI so I can
;play on CRT but see translations on a second monitor.
